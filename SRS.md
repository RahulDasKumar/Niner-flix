# Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and be sure that your group has a `main` branch with this document and the entire [template repository codebase](https://github.com/david-gary/onlineStoreTemplate) either forked or downloaded and copied into your group's repository. If you have arranged to use a different codebase as a template, you do not need to have the original template included, but a `main` branch is still required.

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section. **<-REPLACE THIS SECTION->**

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

* **REQ-1:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  * **Description:** Implementing a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions to automate testing code, and prevent errors.
  * **Type:** `Functional`.
  * **Priority:** 3
  * **Rationale:** To automate testing code, and prevents errors being pushed on to main branch.
  * **Testing:** It can be tested by Github actions and unit tests.
* **REQ-2:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  * **Description:** Make sure users can filter movies by genre
  * **Type:** `Functional`
  * **Priority:** 4.
  * **Rationale:** Makes searching for movies more convenient.
  * **Testing:** See if the logic is working on the front end, nd unit testing on the back-end.
* **REQ-3:** A unique identifier for the requirement. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like REQ-1, REQ-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  * **Description:** Users can see the cover fo the movie

	* **Type**: `Functional`
	* **Priority**: 1
	* **Rationale**: Users often have differing preferences for what browser they use and websites should be ready for these users.
	* **Testing**: Testing can be done by simpily accessing the website on differing browsers and ensuring the site is stable.
* **REQ-EFF**: 
	* **Description**: The website should minimize the amount of information sent over the internet 
	* **Type**: `Functional`
	* **Priority**: 3
	* **Rationale**: Even more so than browsers, users can have a wide varity of internet speeds which can drastically effect the performance of websites, if a site is too bloated users may avoid it.
  * **Testing**: Testing can be done using chrome s throttling feature located within the network tab of the developer panel.
* **REQ-ACC**
  * **Description**: The website should have a login system for users to use.
  * **Type**: `Functional`
  * **Rationale**: In order for users to utilize a cross-device shopping cart they will have to have an account.
  * **Testing**: Testing will be done by creating accounts and utilizing several devices and/or private browsing to ensure the data is properly accessed and utilized.
* **REQ-AAA**
  * **Description**: The website should look good on both the phone and computer.
  * **Type**: `Functional`
  * **Priority**: 4
  * **Rationale**: Users may want to use the websire both on their computer and on their phone.
  * **Testing**: The testing can be done using the website on phone and computer.
* **REQ-BBB**
  * **Description**: Under each image of the movie sould be the title of the movie and the year of release.
  * **Type**: `Functional`
  * **Priority**: 3
  * **Rationale**: Add the title and the year of release so users know what kind of movie it is.

* **REQ-CCC**
  * **Description**: The website should have a navigation menu.
  * **Type**: `Functional`
  * **Priority**: 3
  * **Rationale**: The website should have a navigation menu to allow the user to navigate the site.
  * **Testing**: The testing can be done by seeng if there is a navigation menu on the site, and whether it works.
## Constraints
In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.
* Project is to have comments describing the functionality of any custom methods, classes, and algorithms.
* Code obtained from external sources must be both cited and rewritten if possible.


## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

* **ID:** A unique identifier for the use case. This should be a number that is unique across the entire document (something like UC-1, UC-2, etc. but be sure to replace the word `ID` with the unique identifier).
  * **Description:** A description of the use case that gives the user a high-level overview of how the system is interacted with.
  * **Actors:** A list of the actors that are involved in the use case. Only include the actors that are directly involved. Actors are the people or things that interact with the system. For example, when ordering at a fast food restaurant, one might have the following actors: the customer, the cashier, and the cook. But only the customer and the cashier are directly involved in the use case of ordering food. The cook is not directly involved in the use case of ordering food.
  * **Preconditions:** A list of the preconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the preconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met before the use case can be executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have money in their wallet and the cashier must be logged in to the system before the use case of ordering food can be executed.
  * **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed. Continuing with the restaurant example, the customer must have their food and the cashier must have the customer's money after the use case of ordering food has been executed.
